This web app is meant to help the indecisive couples.

- Able to add items without having doubles. I figured I could do this by implementing a hash table, but in the moment it did not make much sense. 

In the future it might be nice for optimization because the search for duplicates is "linear" (not really since it is in a while loop, if I understand correctly that would be quadratic which is O(n^2)).

Hope to add next:
 - updated css
 - ability to pick the location at which the user is searching for 
 - maybe a "loading options" prompt

 HTML - added a prompt page, at this point the user can also input the location, destination, etc. of the place they would like to eat
 CSS  - added a fading algorithm on the front page
 JS   - added the function to save the input variable
 
 Hope to add next: 
  - next step will have to be adding the user choices to a list and randoimzing them again
  - css will have to wait
